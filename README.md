# Text Classifier

 ## Overview

 This repository contains the code and resources for a text classification model we have used in Abluva. It's designed to automatically categorize text data into predefined classes.

 ## Key Features

Implements various text classification techniques, such as:
Traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest)
Deep learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Transformers)
Capable of handling diverse text input formats, including plain text, HTML, and JSON.
Provides options for pre-trained word embeddings or training custom embeddings.
Offers evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
Can be integrated into larger NLP pipelines.
 ## Getting Started

Prerequisites:
